Hello! 

I am an enthusiastic graduate student with 7 years of field experience in bioinformatics and data science, with an excellent track record of publications in high impact journals. With my data analysis and visualization skills, I can confidently unravel the mysteries of multi-dimensional datasets. I would like to pursue my career in the field of data science where I can utilize my computational, machine learning and statistical skills to understand the complex nature of big data sets.

I am a 4th year PhD student in University of British Columbia. I am a member of [Hach](https://hachlab.org/) and [Lack](https://lacklab.ku.edu.tr/index.html) laboratories. I built computational framework to characterize the impact of the non-coding mutations in prostate cancer for my PhD thesis. During my graduate degree, I developed and optimized streamlined analysis pipelines to process various genomic datasets such as RNAseq, ChIPseq, CRISPR-knockout screens, single-cell RNAseq, whole genome sequencing (~mutation calling). 

Outside of the work, I enjoy [running](https://www.strava.com/athletes/tmorova), playing soccer (Creekside Gym Mon/Thur 6-8pm) and being a plant-daddy (I love my succelents). I also enjoy gaming. During pandemic, I was the main tank healer in Earthshaker-Goons Guild in World of Warcraft (For the alliance!).
