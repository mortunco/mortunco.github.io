  abstract  = "Many genetic variants affect disease risk by altering
               context-dependent gene regulation. Such variants are difficult
               to study mechanistically using current methods that link genetic
               variation to steady-state gene expression levels, such as
               expression quantitative trait loci (eQTLs). To address this
               challenge, we developed the cistrome-wide association study
               (CWAS), a framework for identifying genotypic and
               allele-specific effects on chromatin that are also associated
               with disease. In prostate cancer, CWAS identified regulatory
               elements and androgen receptor-binding sites that explained the
               association at 52 of 98 known prostate cancer risk loci and
               discovered 17 additional risk loci. CWAS implicated key
               developmental transcription factors in prostate cancer risk that
               are overlooked by eQTL-based approaches due to context-dependent
               gene regulation. We experimentally validated associations and
               demonstrated the extensibility of CWAS to additional epigenomic
               datasets and phenotypes, including response to prostate cancer
               treatment. CWAS is a powerful and biologically interpretable
               paradigm for studying variants that influence traits by
               affecting transcriptional regulation.",

  title={Can Quantum-Mechanical Description of Physical Reality Be Considered Complete?},

  abstract={In a complete theory there is an element corresponding to each element of reality. A sufficient condition for the reality of a physical quantity is the possibility of predicting it with certainty, without disturbing the system. In quantum mechanics in the case of two physical quantities described by non-commuting operators, the knowledge of one precludes the knowledge of the other. Then either (1) the description of reality given by the wave function in quantum mechanics is not complete or (2) these two quantities cannot have simultaneous reality. Consideration of the problem of making predictions concerning a system on the basis of measurements made on another system that had previously interacted with it leads to the result that if (1) is false then (2) is also false. One is thus led to conclude that the description of reality as given by a wave function is not complete.},
